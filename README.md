# Hangman
![screenshot](screenshot.jpg?raw=true)
## Overview
This is a small JavaScript-powered Hangman game, designed to be fun, easy, responsive, and mobile-friendly. It uses HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript/AngularJS, and a remote API for retrieving new words that are between 6 and 12 characters. The user is given 6 incorrect attempts before the game ends.
## Background
This project was originally written in 2015 as a personal challenge to design a Hangman game that uses a single SVG image and jQuery to hide/show the SVG's layers based on game status. It was since re-written in AngularJS.
## Requirements
Web server and/or web browser compatible with HTML5, CSS3, AngularJS v1.5.7. This also requires a word source. By default, it uses a predefined list of words, but I recommend requesting a [Wordnik API key](http://developer.wordnik.com/) and placing it in the script.js "APIKey" variable.
